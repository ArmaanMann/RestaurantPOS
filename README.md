# RestaurantPOS

This is a Restaurant Point of Sale System that I created in only Java and it's basic libraries. This project makes use of the swing class
to build a nice GUI that is simple to use and easy to understand.

I made this project to learn more about Java and improve my practical skills on it. I used things like swing, serializable, etc.

I hope you like this software and it can be of some use to someone.
